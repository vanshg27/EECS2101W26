## ‍♂ About This Repository

This repository serves as a living documentation of my journey through **EECS 2101**. The goal is to demystify complex algorithmic concepts by implementing them from scratch and documenting the logic behind the code.

Rather than just storing homework solutions, this repo focuses on:
*   **Implementation:** Building data structures (Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues) from the ground up.
*   **Analysis:** Understanding Time and Space Complexity (Big O Notation).
*   **Application:** Solving LeetCode-style problems relevant to the weekly topics.
